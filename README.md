# simple-website-project
This is my first website built using HTML/CSS and pure JavaScript. 
The form on the contact page uses Ajax via POST and submit data to http://httpbin.org/post.
The website is live at : http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~parkhyey/.

The website meets below requirements. 

# Requirements
  1. The webpages should be presentable as a whole; the interface should be user friendly (text should be easy to read).
  2. The website should contain pictures and/or videos, and they should be presentable as well (placed in a proper place, easy to see, have proper size and resolution).
  3. The website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages. This means 4 total pages will be required.
  4. The homepage has picture carousel animation (slideshow effect, for example, pictures in this page www.nbc.com). This needs to autoscroll and have forward and back buttons.
  5. Have a scroll box in one page. You can put text only or text with pictures inside the scroll box.  The scroll box should have something like a scroll bar to allow users rolling it up and down. 
  6. One page has a form either submit via get or post (enter the email and subscribe, a short survey, etc.) Forms must actually transmit the data somewhere.
  7. One page has an unordered HTML list with several entries. The horizontal menu does not count for this requirement.
  8. There is one button to download files (map to the farm, menu in the restaurant, a personal CV, etc.) The downloaded file can either open in the browser or download to the local computer.
  9. There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages (LinkedIn, Yelp, email, etc.)
  10. You should use at least HTML/CSS and JavaScript in your project.
